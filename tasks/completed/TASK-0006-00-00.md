## User Story
As a developer maintaining the OpenTelemetry inference processors,
I want a simplified project structure that mirrors metricsgenreceiver's approach,
So that the project is easier to maintain while preserving multi-module support for future trace and logs processors.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Complex Makefile and Makefile.common inherited from opentelemetry-collector-contrib
- [x] Complex cmd/ directory structure with otelinferencecol configuration
- [x] Complex internal/ directory with tools and build scripts
- [x] Multi-module structure currently only has one processor (metricsinferenceprocessor)
- [x] Build process is complex and has version conflicts

### Target Structure Analysis (from metricsgenreceiver)
- [x] Simple root Makefile with basic ocb (OpenTelemetry Collector Builder) commands
- [x] Single builder-config.yaml in root referencing the component
- [x] Component in dedicated directory with own go.mod
- [x] Build output goes to simple otelcol-dev/ directory
- [x] Much cleaner and easier to understand

### Multi-Module Considerations
- [x] Keep processor/ directory structure for future expansion
- [x] Each processor maintains its own go.mod for independence
- [x] Root structure supports multiple processors via builder-config.yaml
- [x] Preserve ability to add traceinferenceprocessor/ and loginferenceprocessor/ later

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Simple root Makefile with install-ocb, build, run, clean targets
- [ ] Single builder-config.yaml referencing our metricsinferenceprocessor
- [ ] Remove complex cmd/ directory and internal/ directory from root
- [ ] Preserve processor/metricsinferenceprocessor/ directory unchanged
- [ ] All existing tests pass after refactoring
- [ ] testenv/ integration tests continue to work
- [ ] Multi-module structure preserved for future processors

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- [ ] Build process is significantly simpler
- [ ] No version conflicts in dependencies
- [ ] Project easier to understand for new contributors
- [ ] Documentation reflects new simplified structure
- [ ] Build time faster than current complex approach

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: Simplified Project Structure
  As a developer working with inference processors
  I want a clean, simple project structure
  So that I can focus on processor development rather than build complexity

  Background:
    Given the project has been refactored to mirror metricsgenreceiver
    And the multi-module structure is preserved
    And all build artifacts are cleaned up

  Scenario: Simple build process
    Given I have OpenTelemetry Collector Builder installed
    When I run `make build`
    Then the collector should build successfully into otelcol-dev/
    And the metricsinferenceprocessor should be included
    And no version conflicts should occur

  Scenario: Preserved multi-module structure
    Given the simplified root structure
    When I examine the processor/ directory
    Then processor/metricsinferenceprocessor/ should remain unchanged
    And it should have its own go.mod and tests
    And I should be able to add processor/traceinferenceprocessor/ later

  Scenario: Tests continue to work
    Given the refactored structure
    When I run tests in processor/metricsinferenceprocessor/
    Then all existing tests should pass
    And testenv/ integration tests should work
    And KServe integration should function

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Backup
1. [ ] Document current working functionality (tests, builds, etc.)
2. [ ] Create backup of current state if needed
3. [ ] Analyze dependencies between current cmd/, internal/, and processor/
4. [ ] Identify which files can be safely deleted vs moved

### Phase 2: Create New Simple Structure  
1. [ ] Create new simple Makefile based on metricsgenreceiver pattern
2. [ ] Create new builder-config.yaml referencing our processor
3. [ ] Add otelcol-dev/ to .gitignore for build output
4. [ ] Create new simple README with updated build instructions

### Phase 3: Clean Up Complex Structure
1. [ ] Delete current Makefile and Makefile.common
2. [ ] Delete cmd/ directory entirely
3. [ ] Delete internal/ directory entirely  
4. [ ] Clean up root-level configuration files that are no longer needed
5. [ ] Update .gitignore to remove references to deleted directories

### Phase 4: Preserve Multi-Module Support
1. [ ] Ensure processor/metricsinferenceprocessor/ remains unchanged
2. [ ] Verify processor/ structure supports future additions
3. [ ] Update any cross-references between modules if needed
4. [ ] Test that go.mod in processor works independently

### Phase 5: Validation and Testing
1. [ ] Install OCB (OpenTelemetry Collector Builder)
2. [ ] Test `make build` produces working collector
3. [ ] Run all processor tests: `cd processor/metricsinferenceprocessor && go test ./...`
4. [ ] Test integration: `cd processor/metricsinferenceprocessor && make integration-test-kserve`
5. [ ] Verify collector runs with sample configuration

### Phase 6: Documentation Update
1. [ ] Update main README with new build process
2. [ ] Update processor/metricsinferenceprocessor/README if needed
3. [ ] Add comments to new Makefile explaining targets
4. [ ] Document multi-module expansion process for future processors

## Test Plan

### Build Process Tests
- [ ] `make install-ocb` downloads and installs builder successfully
- [ ] `make build` creates working collector in otelcol-dev/
- [ ] `make clean` removes build artifacts properly
- [ ] `make run` starts collector with test configuration

### Component Tests
- [ ] All existing processor tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [ ] Integration tests work: `make integration-test-kserve`
- [ ] Mock server tests continue to function
- [ ] testenv/ setup works with new collector

### Multi-Module Tests  
- [ ] processor/metricsinferenceprocessor/ builds independently
- [ ] Can add new processor directory alongside existing one
- [ ] builder-config.yaml supports multiple processors
- [ ] Each processor maintains independent versioning

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Simple root Makefile with 4-5 targets (install-ocb, build, run, clean)
- [ ] Single builder-config.yaml in root
- [ ] cmd/ and internal/ directories deleted
- [ ] processor/metricsinferenceprocessor/ unchanged and working
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Build process significantly simpler
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Ready for future traceinferenceprocessor/ and loginferenceprocessor/

### New Makefile Pattern
```makefile
.PHONY: install-ocb
install-ocb:
	# Download OCB for current platform
	
.PHONY: build  
build:
	./ocb --config builder-config.yaml
	
.PHONY: run
run: build
	./otelcol-dev/otelcol --config ./otelcol.yaml
	
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -rf ./otelcol-dev/*
```

### New builder-config.yaml
```yaml
dist:
  name: otelcol
  description: OpenTelemetry Inference Collector
  output_path: ./otelcol-dev

processors:
  - gomod: github.com/rbellamy/opentelemetry-inference/processor/metricsinferenceprocessor v0.0.1
    import: github.com/rbellamy/opentelemetry-inference/processor/metricsinferenceprocessor
    name: 'metricsinferenceprocessor'
    path: 'processor/metricsinferenceprocessor'
    
# Add basic receivers and exporters for functionality
receivers:
  - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/receiver/otlpreceiver v0.127.0
  
exporters:  
  - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/exporter/debugexporter v0.127.0
  - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/exporter/otlpexporter v0.127.0
```

## Notes

### Multi-Module Expansion Plan
When adding future processors:
1. Create `processor/traceinferenceprocessor/` with own go.mod
2. Add entry to builder-config.yaml processors section  
3. No changes needed to root Makefile
4. Each processor remains independently testable and versioned

### Migration Benefits
- **Simpler**: 4-5 Makefile targets vs 50+ current targets  
- **Cleaner**: No complex internal/ tools and build scripts
- **Faster**: Direct OCB usage vs multi-stage build process
- **Maintainable**: Easy to understand for new contributors
- **Expandable**: Clear pattern for adding more processors
