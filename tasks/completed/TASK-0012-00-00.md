**Assignee**: Claude/Development Team
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Parent Task**: N/A
**Dependencies**: N/A
**Estimated Effort**: M (1d)

## User Story
As a metrics engineer using the OpenTelemetry metrics inference processor,
I want output metrics to have the correct resource and data point attributes matching their input metrics,
So that I can properly correlate and query inference results without attribute contamination.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing codebase in processor/metricsinferenceprocessor/
- [x] Document current functionality in processor.go:processInferenceResponse()
- [x] Identify integration points: ResourceMetrics handling, attribute flow
- [x] Note technical constraints: Must preserve existing API compatibility

**Current Issues Identified**:
1. Output metrics are added to the first ResourceMetrics in the batch (line 756 in processor.go)
2. processOutputTensor creates empty data points without copying attributes (lines 1017-1019, 1035-1037)
3. Resource attributes get mixed between different metric sources (hostmetrics vs telemetrygen)
4. Dashboard requires `avg()` workarounds due to duplicate series with different labels

### API Documentation Review
- [x] Latest OpenTelemetry Go API version: v1.28.0
- [x] Relevant interfaces: pmetric.ResourceMetrics, pmetric.DataPoint, pmetric.Attributes
- [x] Breaking changes: None expected for this fix
- [x] New features available: Existing attribute copy methods sufficient

### Technical Research
- [x] Similar implementations reviewed: metricsgenerationprocessor
- [x] Best practices identified: Same-ResourceMetrics pattern, attribute preservation
- [x] Performance considerations noted: Minimal overhead for attribute copying
- [x] Security implications assessed: No security impact, attribute handling only

**Key Insights from metricsgenerationprocessor**:
- Always adds generated metrics to the same ResourceMetrics as source metrics
- Preserves all attributes from source data points via CopyTo()
- Maintains ScopeMetrics association for proper instrumentation context
- Uses in-place modification rather than creating new ResourceMetrics

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] Output metrics must be added to the same ResourceMetrics as their primary input metric
- [x] Data point attributes from input metrics must be copied to output data points
- [x] Resource attributes must not be mixed between different metric sources
- [x] Multi-input scenarios must merge attributes from the primary input metric
- [x] Error handling for cases where input metrics have no ResourceMetrics context
- [x] Performance: Attribute copying overhead < 5% of processing time

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] Code follows existing project style guide
- [x] Documentation updated for attribute handling behavior
- [x] Tests achieve >90% coverage for new attribute logic
- [x] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained

Feature: Proper Attribute Handling in Metrics Inference
  As a metrics engineer
  I want inference output metrics to have correct attributes
  So that I can query and correlate them properly

  Background:
    Given a metrics inference processor is configured
    And the processor has access to MLServer with product model
    And metrics are flowing from hostmetrics and telemetrygen sources

  Scenario: Single input metric attribute preservation
    Given a hostmetrics memory utilization metric with no job label
    And a hostmetrics memory limit metric with no job label
    When the product model processes these inputs
    Then the output metric should have no job label
    And the output metric should be in the same ResourceMetrics as the inputs

  Scenario: No attribute contamination between sources
    Given hostmetrics produces memory metrics with no job label
    And telemetrygen produces gen metrics with job="demo-app" label
    When the product model processes memory metrics
    Then the memory-derived output should have no job label
    And the output should not inherit job="demo-app" from unrelated metrics

  Scenario: Multi-input attribute merging
    Given two input metrics from the same ResourceMetrics with different attributes
    When the inference model processes both inputs
    Then the output metric should be in the same ResourceMetrics
    And the output should inherit attributes from the primary input metric

  Scenario: Dashboard query compatibility
    Given inference output metrics with proper attributes
    When querying metrics in Grafana dashboard
    Then queries should work without avg() workarounds
    And prediction error calculations should be accurate
    And count queries should return correct values

  Scenario Outline: Error handling for edge cases
    Given an inference rule with <input_condition>
    When processing metrics through the inference processor
    Then the system should <expected_behavior>
    And no errors should be logged

    Examples:
      | input_condition | expected_behavior |
      | no input metrics found | skip inference gracefully |
      | input metrics with no attributes | create output with no attributes |
      | input metrics from different ResourceMetrics | use first input's ResourceMetrics |
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Current Code Issues
```go
// PROBLEM: Always adds to first ResourceMetrics (line 756)
resourceMetrics := md.ResourceMetrics().At(0)
scopeMetrics := resourceMetrics.ScopeMetrics().AppendEmpty()

// PROBLEM: Creates empty data points without attributes (lines 1017-1019)
dp := dps.AppendEmpty()
dp.SetTimestamp(timestamp)
dp.SetDoubleValue(value)
// Missing: Attribute copying from input metrics
```

### Proposed Solution
```go
// SOLUTION: Track and use correct ResourceMetrics
func (p *processor) processInferenceResponse(..., inputContext *InputMetricsContext) {
    // Use the ResourceMetrics from the primary input metric
    targetRM := inputContext.PrimaryResourceMetrics
    scopeMetrics := findOrCreateScopeMetrics(targetRM, inputContext.ScopeMetrics)
    // Add output metric to correct ResourceMetrics
}

// SOLUTION: Copy attributes during data point creation
func processOutputTensor(..., inputDataPoints []pmetric.NumberDataPoint) {
    dp := dps.AppendEmpty()
    if len(inputDataPoints) > 0 {
        // Copy attributes from primary input data point
        inputDataPoints[0].Attributes().CopyTo(dp.Attributes())
    }
    dp.SetTimestamp(timestamp)
    dp.SetDoubleValue(value)
}
```

### Files to Modify
- `processor/metricsinferenceprocessor/processor.go`: Main processing logic
- `processor/metricsinferenceprocessor/processor_test.go`: Add attribute tests
- `demo/pipeline/configs/grafana/dashboards/metrics-inference-showcase.json`: Remove workarounds

### Risk Mitigation
- Maintain backward compatibility by making attribute copying additive
- Use defensive programming for edge cases (missing attributes, empty metrics)
- Comprehensive testing to prevent regressions
- Performance monitoring to ensure minimal overhead
