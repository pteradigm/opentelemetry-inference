# TASK-0015 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented an enhanced Kalman Filter with multi-feature prediction capabilities for CPU utilization forecasting. The model uses a 5-dimensional state vector incorporating CPU usage, trend, memory utilization, load average, and context switches.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Model Enhancement (✅ Completed)
- Extended Kalman filter from 2D to 5D state vector
- Implemented cross-correlation state transition matrix
- Added adaptive noise estimation with innovation window
- Created preprocessing pipeline for missing data and outliers
- Integrated multiple system metrics for improved predictions

### 2. Configuration Updates (✅ Completed)
- Updated OpenTelemetry collector configuration
- Configured multi-metric inputs: memory utilization, load averages
- Enabled automatic metadata discovery for outputs
- Successfully integrated with MLServer KServe v2 protocol

### 3. Visualization (✅ Completed)
- Enhanced Grafana dashboard for multi-metric view
- Added panels for prediction variance and innovation
- Displays model confidence and trend analysis
- Real-time visualization of all 5 output metrics

### 4. Testing (✅ Completed)
- Comprehensive unit test suite (12 tests, all passing)
- Tests cover all major components:
  - 5D state vector initialization
  - Preprocessing pipeline
  - Adaptive noise estimation
  - Multi-metric predictions
  - Error handling

## Current Status

### Model Performance
- **Predictions**: Successfully generating predictions
- **Confidence**: Model reports 80-86% confidence
- **Issue**: Currently overestimating CPU usage
  - Prediction: ~40% when actual is ~15%
  - Root cause: CPU estimation from load average needs calibration
  - The formula `cpu = load_average_1m / 8` may need adjustment based on system characteristics

### Technical Details
- State vector: `[cpu_usage, cpu_trend, memory_usage, load_average, context_switches]`
- Cross-correlation matrix models realistic system interactions
- Adaptive noise estimation adjusts to system dynamics
- Innovation window tracks prediction residuals

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Calibration**: Adjust CPU estimation formula or use direct CPU metrics
2. **Tuning**: Fine-tune state transition matrix correlations
3. **Validation**: Run extended accuracy tests (30+ minutes)
4. **Scaling**: Test with different workload patterns
