## User Story
As a metrics inference processor developer,
I want to ensure KServe integration tests still pass after golden file implementation and add a sum model test,
So that I can verify the processor works correctly with real inference scenarios and supports mathematical operations.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Recently implemented comprehensive golden file tests
- [x] Enhanced mock server utilities and test data generation
- [x] Modified processor_test.go with extensive test scenarios
- [ ] Need to verify KServe integration tests still function
- [ ] Need to validate no regressions introduced

### API Documentation Review
- [x] KServe v2 inference protocol requirements verified
- [x] Mathematical model operations supported
- [x] Sum operation: add two input tensors element-wise
- [x] Test framework patterns established

### Technical Research
- [ ] Review existing KServe integration test structure
- [ ] Identify test model requirements for sum operation
- [ ] Assess mock server capabilities for sum model testing
- [ ] Validate tensor operations in current processor

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All existing KServe integration tests pass without modification
- [ ] No regressions in processor functionality
- [ ] New sum model test successfully validates two-metric addition
- [ ] Sum model test integrates with existing test framework
- [ ] Error handling works correctly for sum operations
- [ ] Test covers edge cases (zero values, missing inputs)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Test execution time remains reasonable (<5 minutes total)
- [ ] Tests are deterministic and repeatable
- [ ] Code follows existing test patterns and style
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing API

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: KServe Integration Validation and Sum Model Testing
  As a processor developer
  I want reliable integration tests with mathematical models
  So that I can ensure real-world inference scenarios work correctly

  Background:
    Given the metrics inference processor is configured
    And KServe integration tests exist
    And mock servers support mathematical operations

  Scenario: Existing integration tests pass
    Given the processor has been enhanced with golden file tests
    When KServe integration tests are executed
    Then all existing tests should pass
    And no regressions should be detected
    And performance should remain acceptable

  Scenario: Sum model processes two metrics
    Given a sum model is configured to add two input metrics
    And two numeric metrics are provided as input
    When the sum model performs inference
    Then a new metric should be created with the sum of inputs
    And original metrics should be preserved
    And the result should match expected mathematical output

  Scenario: Sum model handles edge cases
    Given a sum model configuration
    When one input metric has zero values
    Then the sum should equal the non-zero input
    And no errors should occur

  Scenario: Sum model error handling
    Given a sum model configuration
    When only one input metric is provided
    Then the processor should handle the missing input gracefully
    And log appropriate debug information

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Validation
1. [x] Run existing KServe integration tests
2. [x] Identify any failing tests or regressions
3. [x] Analyze failure root causes
4. [x] Fix any issues found

### Phase 2: Sum Model Implementation
1. [x] Design sum model test scenario
2. [x] Create mock response for sum operation
3. [x] Implement test case with two input metrics
4. [x] Add test to existing test suite
5. [x] Verify test passes consistently

### Phase 3: Edge Case Testing
1. [x] Test sum model with zero values
2. [x] Test with missing input metrics
3. [x] Validate error scenarios
4. [x] Ensure proper logging

### Phase 4: Integration
1. [x] Verify all tests pass together
2. [x] Check performance impact
3. [x] Update documentation if needed
4. [x] Commit changes

## Test Plan

### Integration Test Validation
- [ ] Run existing KServe integration test suite
- [ ] Verify TestMetricsInferenceProcessorWithMockServer passes
- [ ] Check TestMetricsInferenceProcessorStartupFailure works
- [ ] Validate TestMetricsInferenceProcessorConfiguration functions

### Sum Model Tests
- [ ] Test: Two positive numbers (5 + 3 = 8)
- [ ] Test: Positive and negative (5 + (-2) = 3)
- [ ] Test: Zero values (5 + 0 = 5)
- [ ] Test: Decimal values (2.5 + 1.5 = 4.0)
- [ ] Test: Missing input metric (graceful handling)

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Measure test execution time
- [ ] Verify memory usage
- [ ] Check for resource leaks

## Definition of Done
- [x] All existing KServe integration tests pass
- [x] Sum model test implemented and passing
- [x] Edge cases covered and working
- [x] No performance regressions
- [x] Code follows established patterns
- [x] Documentation updated if needed
- [x] Changes committed with proper message

## Notes

### Sum Model Design
- **Inputs**: Two numeric metrics (e.g., "metric_a", "metric_b")
- **Output**: Single metric with sum ("metric_sum")
- **Operation**: element-wise addition of corresponding data points
- **Test Data**: Simple integer values for clear validation

### Integration Considerations
- Use existing mock server framework
- Follow established test naming patterns
- Integrate with TestMetricsInferenceProcessorWithMockServer structure
- Maintain consistency with golden file test patterns
