## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: Comprehensive Golden File Testing
  As a processor developer
  I want extensive golden file tests
  So that I can detect regressions and validate complex scenarios

  Background:
    Given the metrics inference processor is configured
    And mock inference servers are available for testing
    And golden file test data exists for comparison

  Scenario: Basic inference processing
    Given a simple CPU prediction model
    When metrics are processed through the inference pipeline
    Then predicted metrics should be generated correctly
    And original metrics should be preserved
    And results should match golden file expectations

  Scenario: Multiple input metric types
    Given filesystem metrics with both sum and gauge types
    When inference is performed using multiple input types
    Then the processor should handle type conversions correctly
    And output metrics should maintain proper types and attributes

  Scenario: Error handling with server failures
    Given an inference server that returns errors
    When metrics are processed
    Then the processor should handle errors gracefully
    And original metrics should pass through unchanged
    And error conditions should be logged appropriately

  Scenario: Multi-model processing
    Given multiple models configured for the same input
    When metrics are processed
    Then all models should generate their respective outputs
    And metric ordering should not affect results
    And all inference results should be included

  Scenario Outline: Data type validation
    Given a model configured for <input_type> inputs
    When metrics with <input_type> data are processed
    Then output should be generated as <output_type>
    And data integrity should be maintained

    Examples:
      | input_type | output_type |
      | float64    | float64     |
      | int64      | int64       |
      | float32    | float32     |
      | mixed      | multiple    |

## Test Plan

### Golden File Tests (19 scenarios)
- [x] Basic inference: single model, multiple outputs, no rules
- [x] Input metric types: sum+gauge, gauge-only, sum-only, multi-attribute
- [x] Multi-model: same input, different inputs, sequential, versioning
- [x] Data types: float32, int32, float64, mixed types, int gauge input
- [x] Error handling: server errors, missing metrics, model not ready

### Integration with Existing Tests
- [x] All golden file tests work with existing mock server framework
- [x] Tests integrate seamlessly with processor_test.go structure
- [x] Mock server utilities enhanced but maintain backward compatibility

### Performance Validation
