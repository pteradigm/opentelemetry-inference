Feature: Multi-Feature Kalman Filter CPU Prediction
  As a system administrator
  I want CPU predictions based on multiple system metrics
  So that I can accurately forecast resource usage

  Background:
    Given the OpenTelemetry collector is running
    And the MLServer has the kalman-filter model loaded
    And hostmetrics receiver collects CPU, memory, and load metrics

  Scenario: Successful multi-metric prediction
    Given the following metrics are available:
      | metric                    | value |
      | system.cpu.utilization    | 0.45  |
      | system.memory.utilization | 0.62  |
      | system.load_average.15m   | 2.3   |
    When the inference processor sends metrics to the Kalman filter
    Then the model returns predictions with:
      | output               | range     |
      | cpu_prediction       | 0.4-0.6   |
      | prediction_variance  | 0.01-0.05 |
      | innovation          | -0.1-0.1  |
    And the prediction accuracy is > 75%

  Scenario: Handling missing metrics gracefully
    Given system.load_average.15m is not available
    When the inference processor sends available metrics
    Then the model uses default values for missing metrics
    And returns valid predictions with increased uncertainty

  Scenario: Adaptive noise estimation
    Given the system experiences sudden load changes
    When innovation sequences show non-white noise characteristics
    Then the filter adjusts process noise covariance Q
    And maintains optimal prediction performance

  Scenario Outline: Prediction accuracy at different horizons
    Given historical metrics for validation
    When predicting <horizon> minutes ahead
    Then accuracy should be > <min_accuracy>%

    Examples:
      | horizon | min_accuracy |
      | 5       | 75           |
      | 15      | 65           |
      | 30      | 55           |
```
