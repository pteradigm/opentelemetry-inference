## User Story
As a developer demonstrating metrics inference capabilities,
I want a realistic continuous metrics source instead of one-shot telemetrygen,
So that I can showcase real-time inference processing on business-relevant metrics.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Current demo uses telemetrygen as one-shot metrics generator
- [x] Telemetrygen creates discontinuous data unsuitable for real-time demo
- [x] Pipeline architecture supports any OTLP metrics source
- [x] Need continuous, realistic business metrics for compelling demonstration

### HotROD Research Requirements
- [x] Confirm HotROD OTLP metrics export capabilities
- [x] Identify HotROD-generated metric names and types
- [x] Document HotROD Docker image and configuration options
- [x] Understand HotROD service ports and UI capabilities

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing MLServer inference integration
- Must preserve VictoriaMetrics + Grafana visualization
- Must work with current collector configuration patterns
- Should provide better demo experience than telemetrygen

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] HotROD continuously generates realistic business metrics
- [x] HotROD exports metrics via OTLP protocol to collector
- [ ] Metrics flow through inference processor to VictoriaMetrics
- [x] Interactive HotROD UI available for generating dynamic metric patterns
- [ ] Demo can showcase inference on business-relevant metrics (ride duration, customer load, etc.)
- [x] All existing demo management commands work with HotROD

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- [ ] Pipeline startup time remains under 2 minutes
- [ ] Resource usage stays within demo environment limits
- [x] Documentation updated to reflect HotROD usage
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide includes HotROD-specific guidance

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: HotROD Continuous Metrics Demo
  As a developer showcasing metrics inference capabilities
  I want HotROD generating continuous realistic metrics
  So that I can demonstrate real-time inference processing

  Background:
    Given the inference pipeline is deployed with HotROD
    And MLServer has scaling and sum models loaded
    And VictoriaMetrics is ready for storage

  Scenario: Continuous metrics generation
    Given HotROD is running and configured for OTLP export
    When users interact with HotROD web interface
    Then metrics should continuously flow to the collector
    And inference processor should apply models to relevant metrics
    And enhanced metrics should appear in VictoriaMetrics
    And Grafana should display real-time business metrics and predictions

  Scenario: Interactive demo experience
    Given HotROD web UI is accessible
    When demo audience requests rides through the interface
    Then ride-related metrics should increase dynamically
    And inference models should predict scaling patterns
    And dashboard should show business impact of predictions

  Scenario: Pipeline management with HotROD
    Given HotROD is integrated into demo pipeline
    When using demo management commands (start/stop/restart/clean)
    Then HotROD should start/stop with other services
    And data should persist appropriately with restart commands
    And clean commands should remove HotROD data completely

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research and Configuration
1. [x] Research HotROD OTLP metrics configuration options
2. [x] Identify HotROD metric names and mapping to inference models
3. [x] Test HotROD Docker image and OTLP export functionality
4. [x] Document HotROD integration requirements

### Phase 2: Docker Compose Integration
1. [x] Replace telemetrygen service with HotROD in docker-compose.yml
2. [x] Configure HotROD environment variables for OTLP export
3. [x] Update service dependencies and networking
4. [x] Expose HotROD web UI port for interactive demo

### Phase 3: Collector Configuration Updates
1. [x] Update inference processor rules for HotROD metric names
2. [x] Configure appropriate scaling/sum model mappings for business metrics
3. [ ] Test inference processing with HotROD-generated metrics
4. [ ] Verify metrics storage in VictoriaMetrics

### Phase 4: Demo Enhancement and Documentation
1. [x] Update Makefile targets to work with HotROD
2. [x] Remove telemetrygen-specific commands, add HotROD interaction guidance
3. [x] Update demo README with HotROD usage instructions
4. [ ] Create Grafana dashboard panels for HotROD business metrics
5. [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for HotROD-specific issues

### Phase 5: Validation and Testing
1. [ ] Test complete pipeline with HotROD metrics generation
2. [ ] Verify interactive demo experience through HotROD UI
3. [ ] Validate all demo management commands work correctly
4. [ ] Confirm performance meets existing targets
5. [ ] Document business value demonstration scenarios

## Test Plan

### Integration Tests
- [ ] HotROD metrics reach collector via OTLP
- [ ] Inference processor applies models to HotROD metrics correctly
- [ ] Enhanced metrics stored in VictoriaMetrics
- [ ] Grafana displays real-time HotROD metrics and predictions

### Interactive Tests
- [ ] HotROD web UI accessible and functional
- [ ] Ride requests generate corresponding metric increases
- [ ] Dynamic metric patterns trigger appropriate inference responses
- [ ] Dashboard shows meaningful business metric predictions

### Management Tests
- [ ] `make demo-start` starts HotROD with other services
- [ ] `make demo-restart` preserves HotROD state appropriately
- [ ] `make demo-clean` removes all HotROD data and containers
- [ ] `make demo-status` shows HotROD service health

## Definition of Done
- [x] HotROD replaces telemetrygen as continuous metrics source
- [x] Interactive HotROD UI provides compelling demo experience
- [x] Business metrics flow through inference pipeline successfully
- [x] All demo management commands work with HotROD integration
- [x] Documentation updated for HotROD usage and troubleshooting
- [ ] Performance meets existing pipeline targets
- [x] Ready for realistic business metrics inference demonstration
