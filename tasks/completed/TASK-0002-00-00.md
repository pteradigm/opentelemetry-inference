**Assignee**: TBD  
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)

## User Story
As a metrics inference processor developer,
I want a simple KServe test environment with a real inference server,
So that I can validate the processor works with actual KServe deployments beyond mock testing.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing mock server implementation in `internal/testutil/mock_server.go`
- [x] Document current test patterns and processor functionality
- [x] Identify KServe v2 protocol endpoints used by processor
- [x] Note processor supports all major tensor types and operations

### API Documentation Review
- [x] Latest KServe version: v2 inference protocol
- [x] Relevant endpoints: ModelInfer, ServerLive, ModelReady, ServerMetadata
- [x] Tensor formats: FP32, FP64, INT32, INT64, BOOL, BYTES supported
- [x] Protocol compliance: Full KServe v2 implementation verified

### Technical Research
- [ ] Research minimal KServe deployment options
- [ ] Identify simplest model format for testing
- [ ] Evaluate container vs local deployment approaches
- [ ] Assess integration with existing test infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Deploy simplest possible KServe inference server
- [ ] Implement basic mathematical model (scaling or addition)
- [ ] Processor can connect and perform inference successfully
- [ ] Integration test demonstrates end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Test environment starts and stops cleanly
- [ ] Error scenarios tested (server down, model not ready)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Test environment setup takes <5 minutes
- [ ] Documentation includes setup and teardown instructions
- [ ] Environment runs consistently across different systems
- [ ] Resource usage is minimal (container-based preferred)

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: Real KServe Integration Testing
  As a processor developer
  I want to test against a real KServe server
  So that I can verify production compatibility

  Background:
    Given a simple KServe inference server is running
    And a basic mathematical model is deployed
    And the metrics inference processor is configured

  Scenario: Successful end-to-end inference
    Given the KServe server is ready
    And the model "simple_scaler" is loaded
    When the processor sends metrics to the inference server
    Then the server should respond with scaled values
    And new metrics should be created with inference results
    And all original metrics should be preserved

  Scenario: Server health check
    Given the KServe server is running
    When the processor starts up
    Then it should successfully connect via ServerLive endpoint
    And log successful connection message

  Scenario: Model not ready
    Given the KServe server is running
    But the model is not loaded
    When the processor attempts inference
    Then it should handle the error gracefully
    And continue processing other metrics

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research & Design
1. [ ] Evaluate KServe deployment options:
   - [ ] Docker Compose with TorchServe/TensorFlow Serving
   - [ ] Standalone Python HTTP server implementing KServe v2
   - [ ] Minimal Kubernetes deployment with KServe
2. [ ] Choose simplest model type:
   - [ ] Mathematical scaling (multiply by factor)
   - [ ] Simple addition/subtraction
   - [ ] Basic linear regression
3. [ ] Design test environment architecture
4. [ ] Create deployment documentation

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. [ ] Create minimal model implementation
2. [ ] Set up KServe server deployment
3. [ ] Create integration test using real server
4. [ ] Add Docker Compose or similar orchestration
5. [ ] Document setup and usage

### Phase 3: Validation
1. [ ] Test with various metric types (Gauge, Sum, Histogram)
2. [ ] Verify error handling scenarios
3. [ ] Performance test with realistic metric volumes
4. [ ] Validate against existing mock server tests
5. [ ] Cross-platform testing

### Phase 4: Documentation
1. [ ] Create setup guide
2. [ ] Document troubleshooting steps
3. [ ] Add to CI/CD pipeline if applicable
4. [ ] Update main project documentation

## Test Plan

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end metric processing with real KServe server
- [ ] Health check and connection validation
- [ ] Model loading and readiness verification
- [ ] Error scenarios (server down, network issues)

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Latency measurement for inference requests
- [ ] Throughput testing with batch metrics
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring

### Compatibility Tests
- [ ] Different metric types (Gauge, Sum, Histogram, etc.)
- [ ] Various tensor shapes and data types
- [ ] Multiple concurrent inference requests

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Minimal KServe test environment deployed and documented
- [ ] Integration test passes consistently
- [ ] Setup time under 5 minutes
- [ ] All error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Documentation complete with troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Environment can be easily torn down and redeployed

## Notes

### Recommended Approach
Start with the simplest possible implementation:
1. **Model**: Basic scaling operation (multiply input by 2.0)
2. **Server**: Python HTTP server implementing KServe v2 protocol
3. **Deployment**: Docker Compose for easy setup/teardown
4. **Test**: Single integration test validating end-to-end flow

### Considerations
- Keep it simple to avoid complexity in initial implementation
- Focus on validating the gRPC communication path
- Ensure easy setup for other developers
- Document any platform-specific requirements
