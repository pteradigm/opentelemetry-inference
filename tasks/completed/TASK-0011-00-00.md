**Estimated Effort**: M (1d)

## User Story
As a platform engineer,
I want to select specific metrics based on their label values in inference rules,
So that I can aggregate related metrics with the same units (e.g., memory used + cached).

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [X] Review existing metric selection code in processor.go
- [X] Document current functionality: Only matches on metric name
- [X] Identify integration points: ConsumeMetrics method, line 350-354
- [X] Note technical constraints: Must maintain backward compatibility

### API Documentation Review
- [X] Latest API version: OpenTelemetry v0.127.0
- [X] Relevant endpoints: pmetric.Metric, pmetric.NumberDataPoint
- [X] Breaking changes: None
- [X] New features available: Attributes on data points

### Technical Research
- [X] Similar implementations reviewed: utils.go has dataPointAttributesMatch
- [X] Best practices identified: Parse selector syntax, filter data points
- [X] Performance considerations noted: Avoid regex in hot path
- [X] Security implications assessed: Validate selector syntax

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Support Prometheus-style label selectors: `metric_name{label="value"}`
- [ ] Support multiple label matches: `metric_name{label1="value1",label2="value2"}`
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility for metrics without selectors
- [ ] Error handling for invalid selector syntax
- [ ] Performance: Parsing overhead < 1ms per rule

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] Documentation updated in README and config examples
- [ ] Tests achieve >80% coverage
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: Label-based metric selection
  As a platform engineer
  I want to select metrics by labels
  So that I can aggregate specific metric subsets

  Background:
    Given a metrics inference processor is configured
    And metrics with labels are being collected

  Scenario: Select metric with single label
    Given a rule with input "system_memory_usage_bytes{state=\"used\"}"
    And metrics exist with various state labels
    When the processor consumes metrics
    Then only data points with state="used" are selected
    And other state values are ignored

  Scenario: Select metric with multiple labels
    Given a rule with input "system_disk_io_bytes{device=\"sda\",direction=\"read\"}"
    And metrics exist with various device and direction combinations
    When the processor consumes metrics
    Then only data points matching both labels are selected

  Scenario: Invalid selector syntax
    Given a rule with input "system_memory_usage_bytes{invalid syntax}"
    When the processor starts
    Then a configuration error is logged
    And the rule is marked as invalid

  Scenario: Backward compatibility
    Given a rule with input "system_cpu_utilization"
    And no label selector is specified
    When the processor consumes metrics
    Then all data points for that metric are selected
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Research
1. [X] Gather requirements from stakeholders
2. [X] Review existing code and documentation
3. [ ] Set up development environment
4. [ ] Create feature branch: `feature/TASK-0011`

### Phase 2: Development
1. [ ] Create label selector parser
2. [ ] Update internalRule struct to store parsed selectors
3. [ ] Modify metric collection logic to filter by labels
4. [ ] Add error handling for invalid selectors
5. [ ] Write unit tests for parser
6. [ ] Write integration tests for end-to-end flow
7. [ ] Update documentation and examples

### Phase 3: Validation
1. [ ] Run all tests locally
2. [ ] Perform manual testing with demo
3. [ ] Code review checklist
4. [ ] Performance testing with 100+ rules
5. [ ] Security scan for injection vulnerabilities

### Phase 4: Deployment
1. [ ] Create pull request
2. [ ] Address review feedback
3. [ ] Merge to main branch
4. [ ] Update demo configuration
5. [ ] Verify in demo environment

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Component: labelSelector - Test cases: parse valid/invalid syntax
- [ ] Function: matchesLabels - Test cases: single/multiple/no matches
- [ ] Edge cases: empty labels, special characters, escaped quotes

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Processor with label selectors in rules
- [ ] Mixed rules with and without selectors
- [ ] Performance with many label combinations

### E2E Tests
- [ ] Demo with memory state selection
- [ ] Demo with disk I/O direction selection
- [ ] Error scenarios with invalid config

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No critical or high severity bugs
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Demo updated and working
