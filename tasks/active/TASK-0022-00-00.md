## User Story
As a ML engineer using probabilistic models like Kalman Filters and Active Inference Agents,
I want the inference processor to properly handle and represent probabilistic outputs (uncertainty, distributions, confidence intervals),
So that I can leverage uncertainty information in downstream monitoring and decision-making systems.

## Context & Research

Feature: Probabilistic ML Model Output Support
  As a ML engineer
  I want probabilistic outputs properly represented
  So that uncertainty information is available for monitoring

  Background:
    Given a Kalman Filter model with probabilistic outputs
    And the processor is configured to handle uncertainty information

  Scenario: Multi-Output Probabilistic Model
    Given a model outputs:
      | tensor_name        | shape | description |
      | state_estimate     | [1]   | Mean prediction |
      | state_variance     | [1]   | Prediction uncertainty |
      | innovation         | [1]   | Measurement residual |
      | confidence_bounds  | [2]   | [lower, upper] bounds |
    When inference completes successfully
    Then output metrics should include:
      | metric_name              | type      | description |
      | cpu.prediction.mean      | gauge     | Point estimate |
      | cpu.prediction.variance  | gauge     | Uncertainty measure |
      | cpu.innovation          | gauge     | Innovation value |
      | cpu.confidence.lower    | gauge     | Lower confidence bound |
      | cpu.confidence.upper    | gauge     | Upper confidence bound |

  Scenario: Distribution as Histogram
    Given a model outputs probability distribution as tensor [bucket_counts]
    And histogram bucket configuration is provided
    When probabilistic output is processed
    Then a histogram metric should be created
    And bucket boundaries should match configuration
    And bucket counts should match tensor values

  Scenario: Covariance Matrix Output
    Given a model outputs covariance matrix as flattened tensor [cov_00, cov_01, cov_10, cov_11]
    When covariance output is processed
    Then individual covariance metrics should be created
    And metrics should include matrix position attributes (row, col)

  Scenario: Uncertainty Configuration
    Given probabilistic output configuration:
      ```yaml
      probabilistic_outputs:
        - tensor_name: "prediction_distribution"
          output_type: "histogram"
          buckets: [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0]
        - tensor_name: "confidence_interval"
          output_type: "bounds"
          confidence_level: 0.95
      ```
    When inference produces these outputs
    Then metrics should be created according to configuration
    And appropriate attributes should be added for uncertainty type

  Scenario Outline: Probabilistic Output Types
    Given a model outputs <tensor_name> with <tensor_values>
    And output configuration specifies <output_type>
    When probabilistic processing occurs
    Then <expected_metrics> should be created
    And uncertainty attributes should be <attributes>

    Examples:
      | tensor_name        | tensor_values | output_type | expected_metrics | attributes |
      | mean_variance      | [0.5, 0.01]   | gaussian    | [mean, std]      | {dist_type: gaussian} |
      | quantiles          | [0.1, 0.5, 0.9] | quantiles | [p10, p50, p90] | {quantile: 0.1/0.5/0.9} |
      | distribution       | [1,3,5,2,1]   | histogram   | histogram        | {bucket_config: custom} |
```
