## User Story
As a DevOps engineer deploying the OpenTelemetry Inference Processor,
I want a strict validation mode that fails hard when model metadata validation fails,
So that I can catch configuration mismatches early and ensure reliable inference operations.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Review current validation implementation in `validateRuleInputs()`
- [ ] Document how validation failures are currently handled (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Identify where configuration would be added (`Config` struct)
- [ ] Note current logging behavior for validation failures

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Review OpenTelemetry Collector configuration patterns
- [ ] Check how other processors handle strict validation modes
- [ ] Document best practices for processor configuration

### Technical Research
- [ ] Review error handling patterns in OpenTelemetry ecosystem
- [ ] Identify appropriate error types for validation failures
- [ ] Research configuration validation at startup vs runtime
- [ ] Assess impact on processor reliability

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Add `strict_validation` boolean field to `Config` struct
- [ ] When `strict_validation: true`, validation failures must cause processor startup to fail
- [ ] When `strict_validation: true`, runtime validation failures must cause the entire metrics batch to be dropped
- [ ] When `strict_validation: false` (default), maintain current graceful behavior
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for both strict and non-strict modes
- [ ] Validation failures in strict mode should return descriptive error messages

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] Documentation updated in processor README
- [ ] Tests achieve >80% coverage for new functionality
- [ ] No performance regression in non-strict mode
- [ ] Configuration schema documented

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: Strict Validation Configuration
  As a DevOps engineer
  I want to configure strict validation mode
  So that configuration mismatches cause hard failures

  Background:
    Given a metrics inference processor is configured
    And model metadata is available for validation

  Scenario: Strict validation disabled (default behavior)
    Given strict_validation is set to false
    When input metrics fail validation against model metadata
    Then the processor should log validation errors
    And continue processing other rules
    And pass through original metrics unchanged

  Scenario: Strict validation enabled at startup
    Given strict_validation is set to true
    And a rule is configured with invalid input specifications
    When the processor starts up
    Then processor startup should fail
    And a descriptive error message should be logged
    And the error should reference the specific validation failure

  Scenario: Strict validation enabled at runtime
    Given strict_validation is set to true
    And the processor has started successfully
    When input metrics fail validation against model metadata
    Then the entire metrics batch should be dropped
    And an error should be logged with validation details
    And no inference requests should be sent

  Scenario Outline: Validation failure types in strict mode
    Given strict_validation is set to true
    When validation fails due to <failure_type>
    Then the processor should <action>
    And log message should include <error_details>

    Examples:
      | failure_type          | action                    | error_details                |
      | input count mismatch  | fail startup/drop batch  | expected vs actual count     |
      | data type mismatch    | fail startup/drop batch  | expected vs actual type      |
      | shape incompatibility | fail startup/drop batch  | expected vs actual shape     |
      | missing input metric  | fail startup/drop batch  | missing metric name          |
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Configuration Setup
1. [ ] Add `strict_validation` field to `Config` struct in `config.go`
2. [ ] Add configuration validation in `createDefaultConfig()`
3. [ ] Update configuration example files with strict validation option
4. [ ] Add configuration documentation

### Phase 2: Startup Validation
1. [ ] Create `validateConfigurationAtStartup()` method
2. [ ] Call validation during processor `Start()` method
3. [ ] Return descriptive errors for configuration mismatches
4. [ ] Add appropriate error logging

### Phase 3: Runtime Validation
1. [ ] Modify `validateRuleInputs()` to check strict mode flag
2. [ ] Update error handling in `processMetrics()` for strict mode
3. [ ] Implement batch dropping logic for strict validation failures
4. [ ] Add comprehensive error logging with context

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
1. [ ] Write unit tests for strict validation configuration
2. [ ] Write integration tests for startup validation failures
3. [ ] Write integration tests for runtime validation failures
4. [ ] Update processor README with strict validation documentation
5. [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for validation failures

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Config struct validation with strict_validation field
- [ ] Startup validation logic with various failure scenarios
- [ ] Runtime validation behavior in strict vs non-strict modes
- [ ] Error message formatting and content

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Processor startup with invalid configurations in strict mode
- [ ] Metrics processing with validation failures in strict mode
- [ ] Graceful degradation in non-strict mode (existing behavior)
- [ ] Configuration parsing from YAML

### E2E Tests
- [ ] Full collector pipeline with strict validation enabled
- [ ] Error propagation through OpenTelemetry pipeline
- [ ] Performance impact measurement

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated (README, configuration examples)
- [ ] No performance regression in non-strict mode
- [ ] Configuration schema documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide updated
