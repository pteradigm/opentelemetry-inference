## User Story
As a platform engineer monitoring the OpenTelemetry Inference Processor,
I want metrics that track validation success/failure rates and reasons,
So that I can monitor system health and detect configuration issues quickly.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Review existing metrics in the processor (if any)
- [ ] Document current logging for validation events
- [ ] Identify validation failure points that should be measured
- [ ] Check OpenTelemetry Collector metrics patterns

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Review OpenTelemetry metrics API for processor instrumentation
- [ ] Check metric naming conventions for collectors
- [ ] Document standard metric types (counters, gauges, histograms)
- [ ] Review metric label/attribute best practices

### Technical Research
- [ ] Review other OpenTelemetry processors for metric patterns
- [ ] Research validation monitoring best practices
- [ ] Identify key validation metrics for alerting
- [ ] Assess performance impact of metric collection

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Add validation success/failure counters by model and rule
- [ ] Track validation latency histogram for performance monitoring
- [ ] Count validation failure types (data type, shape, missing inputs)
- [ ] Add gauge for current number of active validation rules
- [ ] Include model name and validation type as metric labels
- [ ] Metrics should be exposed via OpenTelemetry metrics pipeline

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Metric collection overhead should be <1% of processing time
- [ ] Metric names follow OpenTelemetry naming conventions
- [ ] Labels have low cardinality to prevent metric explosion
- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for metric collection

## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: Validation Metrics Collection
  As a platform engineer
  I want validation metrics exposed
  So that I can monitor processor health

  Background:
    Given the inference processor is running
    And validation is enabled for configured models

  Scenario: Successful Validation Metrics
    Given input metrics match model metadata perfectly
    When validation is performed
    Then validation_success_total counter should increment
    And validation_duration_seconds histogram should record timing
    And metrics should include model_name and rule_id labels

  Scenario: Failed Validation Metrics
    Given input metrics fail data type validation
    When validation is performed
    Then validation_failure_total counter should increment
    And failure_reason label should be "data_type_mismatch"
    And validation_duration_seconds should still record timing

  Scenario: Validation Latency Tracking
    Given validation is configured for multiple models
    When validation runs for 100 metric batches
    Then validation_duration_seconds should show P50, P95, P99 latencies
    And latencies should be broken down by model_name

  Scenario Outline: Failure Reason Classification
    Given validation fails due to <failure_cause>
    When metrics are collected
    Then validation_failure_total should increment
    And failure_reason label should be <expected_reason>

    Examples:
      | failure_cause           | expected_reason      |
      | data type mismatch      | data_type_mismatch   |
      | shape incompatibility   | shape_mismatch       |
      | missing input metric    | missing_input        |
      | input count wrong       | input_count_mismatch |
      | metadata unavailable    | metadata_unavailable |
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Metric Infrastructure
1. [ ] Add OpenTelemetry meter to processor struct
2. [ ] Define metric instruments (counters, histograms, gauges)
3. [ ] Create metric collection helper methods
4. [ ] Add metric configuration to processor config

### Phase 2: Validation Metrics Implementation
1. [ ] Add success/failure counters in validation methods
2. [ ] Implement latency measurement around validation calls
3. [ ] Add failure reason classification logic
4. [ ] Include appropriate labels (model_name, rule_id, failure_reason)

### Phase 3: Advanced Metrics
1. [ ] Add gauge for active validation rules count
2. [ ] Implement model-specific validation rate tracking
3. [ ] Add metrics for validation cache hit/miss rates
4. [ ] Create validation health indicators

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. [ ] Integrate metrics into existing validation flow
2. [ ] Add unit tests for metric collection
3. [ ] Add integration tests verifying metric values
4. [ ] Update documentation with metric descriptions

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Metric instrument creation and configuration
- [ ] Counter increments for success/failure scenarios
- [ ] Histogram timing measurements
- [ ] Label assignment and cardinality limits
- [ ] Metric collection performance impact

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end metric collection with real validation scenarios
- [ ] Metric export through OpenTelemetry pipeline
- [ ] Metric aggregation and temporal behavior
- [ ] Memory usage with metric collection enabled

### E2E Tests
- [ ] Metric visibility in monitoring systems
- [ ] Alert triggering on validation failure rates
- [ ] Performance impact measurement under load

## Validation Metrics Specification

### Metric Definitions
```yaml

  type: counter  
  description: Total number of validation failures
  labels: [model_name, failure_reason] # reasons: data_type_mismatch, shape_mismatch, etc.
