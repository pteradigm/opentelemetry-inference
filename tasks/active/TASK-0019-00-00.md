## User Story
As a ML engineer using complex models with multi-dimensional tensors,
I want the inference processor to properly validate tensor shapes and dimensions,
So that I can catch shape mismatches early and prevent runtime inference errors.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Review current shape validation in `validateInputShape()`
- [ ] Document current limitations (only scalar and 1D tensors)
- [ ] Identify existing warning message for multi-dimensional tensors
- [ ] Analyze tensor shape handling in `metricToInferInputTensor()`

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Review KServe v2 tensor specification for shape definitions
- [ ] Document variable dimension syntax (-1 dimensions)
- [ ] Review tensor reshape requirements and limitations
- [ ] Check OpenTelemetry metrics data model constraints

### Technical Research
- [ ] Research tensor shape validation best practices
- [ ] Review NumPy/TensorFlow shape compatibility rules
- [ ] Identify common ML model input shape patterns
- [ ] Assess memory and performance implications

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Support validation of 2D, 3D, and higher-dimensional tensors
- [ ] Handle variable dimensions (-1) correctly with dynamic size checking
- [ ] Validate batch dimensions and broadcasting compatibility
- [ ] Support tensor reshaping when shapes are compatible but different
- [ ] Provide detailed error messages for shape mismatches
- [ ] Handle edge cases: empty shapes, zero dimensions, undefined shapes

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Shape validation should complete within 1ms per tensor
- [ ] Memory usage should not significantly increase during validation
- [ ] Code follows project style guide and patterns
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all shape scenarios
- [ ] Documentation includes shape validation examples

Feature: Multi-Dimensional Tensor Shape Validation
  As a ML engineer
  I want comprehensive tensor shape validation
  So that model input shape mismatches are caught early

  Background:
    Given a model with defined input tensor shapes
    And metrics with various data point configurations

  Scenario: 2D Tensor Validation
    Given a model expects input shape [batch_size, features] = [-1, 10]
    When input metrics have 10 data points per batch
    Then validation should pass
    And tensor should be shaped as [1, 10] for single batch

  Scenario: 3D Tensor Validation
    Given a model expects input shape [batch, height, width] = [1, 28, 28]
    When input metrics provide exactly 784 data points (28*28)
    Then validation should pass
    And tensor should be reshaped to [1, 28, 28]

  Scenario: Variable Dimension Handling
    Given a model expects input shape [-1, 5] (variable batch size)
    When input metrics provide 15 data points
    Then validation should pass
    And tensor should be shaped as [3, 5]

  Scenario: Shape Mismatch Detection
    Given a model expects input shape [1, 10]
    When input metrics provide 7 data points
    Then validation should fail
    And error message should specify expected vs actual shape
    And error should suggest valid data point counts

  Scenario: Tensor Reshaping
    Given a model expects input shape [2, 3, 4] (total: 24 elements)
    When input metrics provide 24 data points in 1D
    Then validation should pass with reshaping
    And tensor should be reshaped to [2, 3, 4]

  Scenario Outline: Complex Shape Validation
    Given a model expects input shape <expected_shape>
    When input metrics provide <data_points> data points
    Then validation should <result>
    And tensor shape should be <final_shape>

    Examples:
      | expected_shape | data_points | result | final_shape |
      | [1, 5]         | 5          | pass   | [1, 5]      |
      | [-1, 2]        | 6          | pass   | [3, 2]      |
      | [2, 2, 2]      | 8          | pass   | [2, 2, 2]   |
      | [3, 3]         | 7          | fail   | N/A         |
      | []             | 1          | pass   | []          |
```
